        Here at The Colorado Experience we provide several levels of climbing instruction,
        all tailored to your individual strengths, interests and comfort levels. You
        can start your lessons on small one and two pitch climbs and move up to larger
        routes. We cover everything from working with hand and footholds to working
        with ice axes. Lessons are always under the watchful and encouraging eye
        of an experienced instructor. Special instruction is also available for 
        those with special physical needs or requirements.
