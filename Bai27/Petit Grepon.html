        The Petit Grepon is one of Rocky Mountain National Park's most challenging and awesome climbs.
        Nestled in the middle of the Cathedral Spires, the summit of the Petit
        Grepon is a mere ten by thirty foot perch, but "placemat" may be a better term.
        For those who are more interested in a less intimidating climb, we also offer
        tours up Sharkstooth, a nearby summit offering excellent views of the Petit Grepon.
